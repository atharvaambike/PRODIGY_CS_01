# PRODIGY_CS_01

🔒 Introducing a Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption tool with a sleek Tkinter GUI built in Python! 💻

🔐 With this tool, you can easily encrypt or decrypt text using a customizable shift key. It provides a seamless user experience with input validation to ensure smooth operation.

👉 Choose your action - encryption or decryption, input your shift key, and the text. The program handles incorrect inputs gracefully with warning messages.

💡 This project was a fantastic learning experience, allowing me to enhance my Python skills while exploring GUI development with Tkinter.
